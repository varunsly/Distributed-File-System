# Distributed-File-System
This project implements a distributed file system using the Raft consensus algorithm for leader election and log replication. The system provides basic file operations with replication across multiple servers for fault tolerance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Distributed file storage and retrieval
- Replication for fault tolerance
- Leader election using Raft consensus algorithm
- Basic file operations (create, read, write, delete)
- Lease-based concurrency control
- Simulated network communication between nodes

## Components

- `main.py`: Entry point of the application, sets up the network and demonstrates system functionality.
- `client.py`: Implements the client interface for interacting with the file system.
- `file_server.py`: Extends RaftNode to implement file operations and manage file storage.
- `raft_node.py`: Implements the Raft consensus algorithm for leader election and log replication.
- `network_manager.py`: Simulates network communication between nodes.
- `file.py`: Defines data structures for files, versions, and leases.
- `message.py`: Defines the message structure for inter-node communication.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distributed-file-system.git
   cd distributed-file-system



2. Open a terminal in the project folder
  Run python main.py

***Notes : This will start a demo of the system, showing how files are created, read, and updated across multiple servers. Customizing***

In main.py, you can change the number of servers
Also in main.py, you can set where files are stored on your computer
